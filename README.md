# Science Fair AI models (Dev repo)

This repository is for development of the AI. Everything (including Dockerfile) for development will be stored here and transfered to the main repo before the Science Fair.

To read documentation,
go to <https://docs.science-fair-dev.patriotsoftwaremn.com>

**Note, I have moved to using a basic minimax algorithm.
I moved to using a minimax algorithm because, I am running out of time before the Science Fair.
I will continue to work on the more advanced Tic Tac Toe AI after the Science Fair.*
