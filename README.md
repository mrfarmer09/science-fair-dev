# Science Fair AI models (Dev repo)
This repository is for development of the AI. Everything (including Dockerfile) for development will be stored here and transfered to the main repo before the Science Fair.

## Docker
The development docker image will not be posted to docker hub, so if you want to use docker (which I highly advise you too), you will have to build it your self.

If you made any changes to the code and you want to contribute, please don't make a new docker image. Please export it out of the docker container so I can review.

If you are using Windows (10 or 11) I would highly recommend you use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) because I will be developing the AI models in WSL2.
